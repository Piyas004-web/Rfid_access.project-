#RFID-Access Project
I am excited to share my recent project “RFID-Based Access Control System” using Arduino. This project highlights the potential of IoT and embedded systems in enhancing security and automation, and access management. 🎓 ✨ 

Overview & Purpose 💡 

The system leverages RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to grant or deny access based on authorized RFID tags. It ensures secure and contactless access control, making it ideal for workplaces, labs, parking lots, or even personal use for secure rooms. 

Components Used🔧 

Arduino Uno R3: The brain of the system, processes inputs and controls outputs.
RFID Reader (RC522): Detects and reads unique IDs from RFID tags.
RFID Tags (Keychains/Cards): Each tag contains a unique ID for identification.
Buzzer: Provides audible feedback for access granted or denied. 
Resistors & LEDs (x2): For the output/feedback of the system. 
Jumper Wires & Breadboard: For connecting components.

Working Principle⚙️ 

1. The RFID reader detects nearby RFID tags and retrieves their unique IDs.
 2. The Arduino Uno compares the tag's ID with a predefined list of authorized IDs.
 3. If the tag is authorized, the software gives the feedback “Access Granted” and the green LED is turned on. 
 4. If the tag is unauthorized, the software gives the feedback “Access denied”, the red LED is turned on and the buzzer sounds a warning. 

Applications📔 

Secure Rooms or Labs: Restrict access to authorized personnel.
Libraries: Allow only members to borrow books.
Parking Systems: Automate entry and exit based on RFID-enabled vehicles.
Attendance Systems: Track entry and exit of employees or students.

This project gave me hands-on experience in integrating IoT, microcontrollers, and RFID technology to solve real-world problems. It was a great learning opportunity to work with sensors, actuators, and embedded systems programming.
